            TextUtils is a ReactJs website built primarily to do various
            operations on regular typed text. You can safely use WordPad or
            NotePad for text drafting, and saving, but TextUtils offers much
            more than simple text drafting and formatting. TextUtils can convert
            your text to any case in just one simple click of a button.
